## Foreword
Welcome to this small project where I catalog various connectors and electrical systems for B-series (BA/BF) Ford Falcons.
This information is useful for creating custom harnesses without cutting into fsctory ones, customising existing systems or even communicating with modules.

## A Note on Toyota
Most electrical systems made for the Ford Falcon and the Holden Commodore were made by either Sumitomo or Yazaki; there are a few exceptions, however, where TE Connectivity (AMP) or Bosch did make connectors for specific components.

As Sumitomo and Yazaki (known locally as 'Australian Arrow') both produce a lot of harnesses and connectors for Toyota, it is often easy to identify certain connectors by using the Toyota Wire Harness Repair Manual which will lead you to sources for pins and housings.

You need to add `90980-` to the front of a 5-digit code printed in tiny text on the connector housing in order to find replacement connectors online.
